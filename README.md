# Oliver Laskow's Final Project

Creates a visualization using Bokeh with data from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality)

- Data describes air quality of NYC with different particles from ~2005 to ~2021

- Each y-axis is a different measure, the data is meant more for a trendline than spesific data points

- Downloading rainbow.csv is **unneccesary** for viewing Air_Quality.csv

## Scales for particles
- Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is in ppb

- Fine particles (PM 2.5) is in mcg/m3

- Ozone (O3) is in ppb

- Annual vehicle miles traveled is in million miles per km2

- Boiler Emissions- Total SO2 Emissions is in Number per km2

- Boiler Emissions- Total PM2.5 Emissions is in Number per km2

- Boiler Emissions- Total NOx Emissions is in Number per km2

- Annual vehicle miles travelled (cars) is in million miles per km2

- Annual vehicle miles travelled (trucks) is in million miles per km2

- Outdoor Air Toxics - Formaldehyde is in µg/m3

- Outdoor Air Toxics - Benzene is in µg/m3
